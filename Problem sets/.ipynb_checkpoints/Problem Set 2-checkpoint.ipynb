    "using ``m = marith.Matrix(a, b, c, d)``. Matrix addition and multiplication should use the standard ``+`` and ``*`` operators, respectively, and scalar multiplication should be accomplished by calling a method called ``scale`` on your ``Matrix`` class, which takes a scalar as an argument, e.g. ``B = A.scale(3)``. Your module should also include constants called ``identity`` and ``zero`` which are the $2 \\times 2$ identity and zero matrices, respectively. Place your module in the same directory as this notebook and then test it by running the following code:"

Note that, if we pass an instance of one of our classes to the built-in ``print`` function, ``print`` will look for a method called ``__str__`` on your class which returns a string. It will then print the string returned by ``__str__`` to the screen. Add an appropriate ``__str__`` method to your ``Matrix`` class and then check that the matrices $B$, $C$ and $D$ above were computed as you expected:"
