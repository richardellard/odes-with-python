Instead, our program is constructed by combining what we call *pure* functions in programming parlance (simply called \"functions\" in mathematics). Pure functions have no *side effects*, that is, they take an input and return an output without having any other effect on the program; in particular, they do not modify any global state. To be strict, we would even avoid the use of mutable local variables in our functions, as this can still be interpreted as modifying state, even if said state is local to the function. If we give up mutable local variables, this means we must even give up our beloved for-loops, as updating any kind of counter variable would be disallowed!\n",

Some languages, such as *Haskell* even enforce a functional style by disallowing all mutable variables!\n",
